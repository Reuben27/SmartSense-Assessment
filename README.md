This repository contains my code for the AI/ML Coding Assessment of smartSense Consulting.

## Getting Started

- Ensure that you have Python 3.10 ainstalled on your laptop. Run the following commands to check the versions of flutter and dart installed.

python --version
```

- Install the requirements.

- Download the yelp_academic_dataset_business.json file from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r2gwdgn8vSX2NPjt6VtrWI7p2L8SHUuu?usp=driv) and save it to the data folder within src (src/data folder).

## Source Code Structure

Structuring the folders is a very important first step in organizing good code. The below figure shows the general structure of the my repository.
